## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here

My project is for a hair salon. It will keep track of stylists, customers, inventory and payments. It can help an individual stylist or a salon with multiple stylists. I will try to make it possible to only use the parts you need.

It would be helpful if it could write this information to a spreadsheet but if not, to generate useful reports. I am not sure at this point if password protection is important for more than the individual using it. I don't intend to include any logging in by customers.

I think it will only be available to one person at this time. The idea came from a hair stylist who needs to transition from being an employee to just renting her station and purchasing her own supplies, keeping inventory and payment.
