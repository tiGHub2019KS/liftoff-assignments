### Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide information for patients who are afflicted with one or more of the following disorders: diabetes (type 1 and 2), hypertension, and celiac disorder. The application aims to provide a number of recipes for meals that are compatible with patient disorders. Users will fill out a questionnaire where they list their disorders, select foods that they are particlarly fond of, and select foods that they do not wish to eat. The application will filter recipes by these answers and then present them to users.

Additionally, the application will assist users in finding patient care within a radius of a certain zip code. Patient care can vary from inpatient hospitals to outpatient clinics.

### Technologies
Java MySQL Angular CLI TypeScript JavaScript Bootstrap


### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to review and re-teach myself JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular in order to work on the front-end, which will connect to a Java-based back-end. I will also have to learn how to connect my front-end to my back-end, as that was not covered in LC101.

Relearn angular and more angular to create front end
